# temperature_convesion

My first Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Temperature Converter App

A Flutter-based mobile application that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. It includes:

Toggle Selection: Choose either °F → °C or °C → °F with radio buttons.

Validated Input: Enter any numeric value; the convert button is enabled only when input is valid.

Real-time Output: Displays the converted value to two decimal places.

Conversion History: Animated list of past conversions; newest entries slide in at the top.

Clear History: Quickly erase all past records with a single tap.

Responsive Layout: Works seamlessly in both portrait and landscape orientations.
